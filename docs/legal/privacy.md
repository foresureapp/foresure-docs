# 🔒 Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 2024**

## 1. Data Collection
Foresure is a decentralized application. We do not collect personal account data (email, password, name) for using the protocol.
*   **On-Chain Data**: All transactions are public on the Base blockchain. Your wallet address and transaction history are publicly visible.
*   **Off-Chain Data**: We may collect anonymous usage statistics (via plausible.io or similar privacy-focused tools) to improve the UI. This includes page views and error logs.

## 2. Cookies
We use local storage to save your user preferences (e.g., "Dark Mode", "Slippage Tolerance"). We do not use third-party tracking cookies for advertising.

## 3. Third-Party Services
*   **RPC Providers**: When you connect your wallet, your IP address may be visible to the RPC provider (e.g., Coinbase, Infura) depending on your wallet settings.
*   **The Graph**: Queries to the subgraph are processed by The Graph's hosted service.

## 4. Data Rights
You have the right to disconnect your wallet at any time. Since we do not hold personal data, there is no "account deletion" process for the protocol itself.
