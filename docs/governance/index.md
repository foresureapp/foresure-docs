Foresure is designed to evolve into a fully decentralized protocol owned and operated by its community.

## Current State: Progressive Decentralization

Currently, the protocol is in the **"Bootstrapping Phase"**.
*   **Admin Control**: A 5-of-8 Multi-Sig wallet held by the core team and early contributors controls protocol parameters.
*   **Guardrails**: Time-locks are enforced on critical upgrades (48-hour delay) to allow users to exit if they disagree with changes.

## The DAO (Future)

We are transitioning towards a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure.

### Voting Power
Voting power will be derived from the future governance token ($SURE).

### Governance Process
1.  **RFC (Request for Comments)**: Discussion on the governance forum.
2.  **Snapshot Vote**: Off-chain signaling vote (gasless).
3.  **On-Chain Execution**: If passed, the proposal is executed on-chain via Governor Bravo contracts.

## Protocol Parameters

The DAO will control:
*   **Fee Rates**: Trading fees (currently dynamic) and Protocol fees (currently 1%).
*   **Oracle Whitelist**: Adding or removing approved oracle adapters.
*   **Market Categories**: Approving new templates (e.g., Sports, Crypto).
*   **Treasury Spending**: Allocating funds for grants, marketing, and development.
