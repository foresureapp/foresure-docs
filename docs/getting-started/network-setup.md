# 🌐 Network Setup: Base

Foresure operates exclusively on the **Base Network**, an L2 built by Coinbase. It offers low fees and high security.

## Automatic Setup

When you connect your wallet to Foresure, we will automatically prompt you to switch to the Base network. Click **Approve** and **Switch Network** in your wallet.

## Manual Configuration

If you need to add Base manually to MetaMask or another wallet, use these details:

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Name** | Base Mainnet |
| **RPC Endpoint** | `https://mainnet.base.org` |
| **Chain ID** | `8453` |
| **Currency Symbol** | `ETH` |
| **Block Explorer** | `https://basescan.org` |

## ⛽ Gas Fees

Base fees are extremely low (typically <$0.01 per transaction). 

*   **ETH**: You need a small amount of ETH on Base to pay for gas.
*   **Bridging**: You can bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Base using the [Official Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/) or use a centralized exchange like Coinbase to withdraw directly to Base.

If you are using Coinbase Smart Wallet, gas fees may be sponsored for your transactions!
