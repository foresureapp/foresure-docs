# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Foresure?
Foresure is a decentralized prediction market on the Base Network where you can trade on the outcome of future events.

### Do I need to sign up?
No. There is no email or password signup. You simply **Connect Your Wallet** (like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) to start trading immediately.

### Is it legal?
Foresure is a decentralized protocol. Users are responsible for complying with their local laws. We block IP addresses from certain restricted jurisdictions.

### Does Foresure have a token?
**No.** There is currently no $SURE token. Be careful of scams claiming otherwise.

## Trading & Funds

### Where is the "Withdraw" button?
Since Foresure is non-custodial, you don't deposit funds *into* the app. Your funds stay in your wallet. To "withdraw" simply means sending USDC from your wallet to an exchange or bank.

### Can I sell my position early?
**Yes!** You can sell your shares at any time before the market resolves to lock in profits or cut losses. You do not have to wait for the event to end.

### Are there trading limits?
There are no account limits. However, the maximum trade size is limited by the available **liquidity** in the pool. Extremely large trades may suffer from slippage.

### Can I trade outside of the Foresure website?
**Yes.** Because the protocol runs on smart contracts, you can interact directly with the contracts via Etherscan or build your own frontend/bot using our SDK.

### Why are there no orderbooks?
We use a **Hybrid AMM** (Automated Market Maker). This allows for instant trading against a liquidity pool, ensuring you don't need to wait for a matching buyer or seller on the other side.

## Economics

### What are the fees?
*   **Trading Fee**: 1-5% (dynamic based on market volatility).
*   **Redemption Fee**: 0%.

### Why is the max payout $1.00?
We normalize all outcomes to sum to $1.00. This makes calculating probabilities easy (e.g., a price of $0.60 implies a 60% chance).

## Technical

### Which wallet should I use?
We recommend **Coinbase Wallet** for the best experience on Base, but MetaMask and Rainbow work great too.

### Is the code open source?
Yes, our smart contracts and frontend are open source. Check our [GitHub](https://github.com/foresure).

### Is my money safe?
We use audited smart contracts and do not hold custody of your funds. However, all crypto interactions carry risks (smart contract bugs, wallet hacks). Never invest more than you can lose.
