Foresure is **Non-Custodial**. This means we never touch your money until you authorize a trade.

## No Deposit Required
Unlike a traditional brokerage or sports betting site, you **do not** "deposit" funds into Foresure.
*   Your funds sit in your **Crypto Wallet** (e.g., MetaMask).
*   When you trade, the smart contract pulls *exactly* the amount needed for that trade.
*   The rest of your funds remain safe in your wallet.

## Direct from Wallet
All transactions happen directly on the **Base Blockchain**.
*   **USDC**: Used for trading.
*   **ETH**: Used for gas fees (fractions of a cent).

## How to Claim Winnings
When a market resolves and you picked the winner:
1.  Go to **Portfolio** -> **Closed Positions**.
2.  You will see a **"Redeem"** button.
3.  Click it to exchange your winning shares for **USDC**.
4.  The USDC is sent immediately to your wallet.

## How to Withdraw
Since funds are already in your wallet, "withdrawing" simply means moving them to your bank or another chain.
1.  **To Bank**: Send USDC from your wallet to a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) and sell for fiat.
2.  **To Ethereum**: Use the [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/) to move funds back to Ethereum Mainnet.
