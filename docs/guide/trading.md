# 📈 Trading Guide

Everything you need to know about executing trades on Foresure.

## Making Your First Trade
1.  **Connect Wallet**: Top right corner.
2.  **Select Market**: Choose a topic you know well.
3.  **Choose Side**: Click "YES" or "NO".
4.  **Enter Amount**: Input USDC.
5.  **Confirm**: Sign the transaction in your wallet.

## No Orderbooks?
Foresure uses an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**.
*   **Traditional Exchange**: You need a seller to match your buy order.
*   **Foresure**: You trade against a **Liquidity Pool**. This means you can *always* trade, even if no other user is online. The price adjusts automatically based on supply and demand.

## Using Probability Charts
Our charts show the history of the "YES" price over time.
*   **Trend Lines**: Spot momentum shifts (e.g., a candidate gaining popularity).
*   **Volume Bars**: See how much money is being traded. High volume usually means the current price is more "accurate".

## Can I sell early?
**YES!** You do not have to wait for the event to end.
*   **Scenario**: You bought "YES" at $0.40. The news is good, and the price rises to $0.70.
*   **Action**: You can sell your position immediately to lock in a $0.30 profit per share.
*   **How**: Go to **Portfolio** -> Click **Sell**.

## Trading Limits
*   **No Account Limits**: We don't cap your account size.
*   **Liquidity Limits**: The only limit is the size of the liquidity pool. If you try to buy $1M in a small market, you will suffer high **Slippage**. The UI will warn you if your trade is too large for the pool.
