Foresure is a decentralized protocol. While we strive for security, using DeFi applications involves inherent risks. Please read this section carefully before trading or providing liquidity.

## Smart Contract Risk
Foresure runs on public smart contracts.
*   **Bugs**: Despite audits, code may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Immutability**: Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. If you interact with a malicious contract or send funds to the wrong address, they cannot be recovered.

## Market Risk
Prediction markets are volatile.
*   **Loss of Capital**: You can lose 100% of your investment if the market resolves against your position.
*   **Liquidity Risk**: Low liquidity may result in high slippage (getting a worse price than expected) or the inability to exit a position large position.

## Oracle Risk
We rely on the Optimistic Oracle mechanism.
*   **Dispute Delays**: If a market is disputed, settlement may be delayed by days or weeks.
*   **Resolution Error**: While the dispute system is designed to find the truth, there is a theoretical risk of a "51% attack" on the oracle or jury system, leading to incorrect resolution.

## Regulatory Risk
Prediction markets occupy a complex legal gray area in many jurisdictions.
*   **Compliance**: It is your responsibility to ensure that using Foresure is legal in your country of residence.
*   **Geoblocking**: We may restrict access to the frontend interface for users in certain jurisdictions (e.g., USA, OFAC sanctioned countries) to comply with laws.

## Technology Risk
*   **L2 Risk**: Base is an Optimistic Rollup. In the event of a sequencer failure or fraud proof dispute, funds could be temporarily inaccessible.
*   **Wallet Security**: You are solely responsible for the security of your private keys. If your wallet is compromised, we cannot help you.
